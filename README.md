# Paws-in-the-city
## Inspiration
Empathy and compassion are very much needed in our society not only towards humans but also towards other living beings around us.
We have seen so many applications being made for humans and their wellbeing but there are very few for animals. To provide support and justice to the animals living around us (stray or pet) we have made a platform where several animals and pet related things are integrated together.

## What it does
We have several sections in our application which serve various different purposes to support the animal community.
Volunteers can register themselves in various sections according to their interest.
The sections are
1. **Donations for animal NGOs**: General public can donate and help these helpless souls at times of need.
2. **Adoption of pets**: Animals like dogs and cats which are available for adoption can be uploaded in this section of the application along with the necessary details.
3. **Pet Events**: A section dedicated for all the pet events and meet-n-greets happening around the city.
4. **Animal Cruelty Report**: A section to report animal cruelty complaints so that necessary action can be taken by respective authorities.

## How we built it
We used basic web development tools like HTML, CSS JS to build our web application.

## Challenges we ran into
We are not used to building applications much. It was challenging for us to put our idea into the several functionalities in our web application.

## Accomplishments that we're proud of
We built this application in a very short span of time and we hope this will be really helpful for the animals which are in need.

## What we learned
Managing time and implementing our idea into a reality.

## What's next for  **Paws in the City**
We want to build this application with better technologies for everyone to use it and help the other living beings in need.
